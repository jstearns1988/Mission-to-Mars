# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
While assisting Robin with her Mars web app, she decided she would like to include all four Mars hemisphere images to add more polish. I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and titles, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

#### The following steps were taken to complete this analysis
  - Scrape full-resolution Mars Hemisphere images and titles
  - Updated the web app with Mars Hemisphere images and titles
  - Added Bootstrap 3 components
